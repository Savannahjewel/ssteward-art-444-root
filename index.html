    <p class="paragraph">Hello! My name is Savannah, and my friends call me Sav. I am based in San Diego, Ca for now, and will see where life takes me from there!
      I am a graphic designer who will be receiving my bachelor’s degree from San Diego State University in May 2025.  
      I have a strong sense of branding and color and I believe I can be an asset to any company who needs help finding their brand identity and wants to further their aesthetic on social media and packaging design.
      I work well on any team, and I am a positive person who will do all I can to help build your brand to its fullest potential. If you want to work with me, reach out to me below! </p>

      <h4 class="h4">What are your goals post grad?</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">When I get my bachelor's degree I would love to find a design agency that aligns with my values and fits into my aesthetic design wise. Ideally I would love to work in the branding and packaging space for breweries or the beauty industry.</p>
      <h4 class="h4">What separates you as a designer?</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">I believe what separates me as a designer is my ability to use color and branding in an effective way that represents the brand. I love whimsical and unique designs and I don’t shy away from bold.</p>
      <h4 class="h4">Why hould I hire you?</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">Point blank, why I think I am a great designer and asset to any team is my creativity and inspiration has no limits.  I will be excited to create your brand for you and I will work well with any team to execute your vision.</p>
      <h4 class="h4">What work are you most proud producing at SDSU?</h4>
      <p class="paragraph">I think so far what I have been most proud of at SDSU was creating a guidebook to local dive bars and turning it into a physical booklet, with an app that coinsides with the book.</p>
